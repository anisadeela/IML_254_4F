            <p>My journey began at Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Jerai, where I met some of my first and dearest friends. These friendships were built on shared childhood adventures, learning experiences, and the simple joys of growing up together. Though we’ve taken different paths, the memories we created remain a treasured part of my life.</p>
